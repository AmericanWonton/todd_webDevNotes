So the challange is we need to make a server that responds to different Methods,(Like Get, Post, what have you) and
different URIs. So, we know how to read the connection requests in text...and we know how to get the methods in text, 
based on line 1, (same for the URI). 

Lets make a 'Get' Method example, (with a URI of dankURI) and 'Post' Method, (with a URI of alsoDankURI) to handle different
requests from different places!
