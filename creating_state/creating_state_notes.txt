54. Passing Values through a URL

55. Passing values through a form

56. UPloading a file, reading a file, creating file on server.
Might want to do some examples on this...

57. Enctype
That's that enctype="multipart/form-data" nonsense. Encytype is the encoding type
Anytime you create a form where a User can submit a form with a file, you need this.
If you want to learn how to do this,  just look at his video again.

58. Redirects
We can redirect a request from one place to another. The URL says give me the resource at THIS location.
A serfer can be like, "Hey, this stuff moved, or we want you over here," then redirects you to a different succes
page.
There's some constants for  redirects,(and other success/fail codes).
The redirects are in the 300 category.
For instance, if you ask for '/dog' and the server gives a status code 301, moved permanantly, 
the server responds saying, 'here, it's at /doggie now', and then the browser will go to /doggie from 
now on.
303 see other, moves the method to GET. 302 is still there,(for legacy applications).
307 preserves the same METHOD. 

59. Redirect Codes Diagrams
rfc73421 definitive  status code for servers. Google it if you aren't sure. 
Watch video for pretty pictures and explanations.
If you have /doggie saved in your browser, your browser ignores /dog, unless you clear the browser. 
418 adn 420 are gone.
