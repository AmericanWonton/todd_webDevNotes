66. Sessions. We can give the User a cookie, which gives them a unique ID and we can KNOW who is communicating 
with the server. 
We can store the unique ID in the cookie OR in the URL, appended to the URL 
If we are using https secure connection, then we can securely do that as well. 

67. Universally Unique ID 
There's some 3rd party packages you can use to generate these. 
You can read about UUIDs on wikepedia to learn more. 

68. Your First Session 
Todd gave us a little diagram about sessions 
Sessions come and go...User information is stored!

If files are in the same folder, you can distrubute code across multiple files...something I had to learn on my own >:(
