20. Understanding Servers

There's a bunch of ways to say server: multiplexer, mux, http multiplexer, server, router, etc.

The web works on a client/server structure. Based upon the URL, the server runs special logic, then returns stuff
for the request. Based upon certain conditions, it routes to what needs to be done,(including the http method).

Based upon the OSCI Model, (Google it) there's an architecture for how stuff gets done on the web. 
We have to understand stuff for TCP and HTTP. TCP is Text Control Protocol. It is used to send stuff. 
HTTP is Hyper Text Transform Protocol and it is TCP with a ruled structure, (on top of TCP).

Structure of an HTTP Request: 
1. Request Line (example: Method SP request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF) or (GET /path/to/file/index.html HTTP/1.0)
2. Headers
3. Optional Message Body

Structure of an HTTP Response:
1. Status Line (HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP reason-Phrase CRLF) or (HTTP/1.0 200 OK)
2. Headers
3. Optional Message Body

IETF regulates teh rules for this

Make sure the spacing is correct on the HTTP Request AND Response! It has a format to follow!
You can see examples of this. Open chrome, open developer tools, go to "Network", type in a site name and open the Headers
Or you can do curl -v google.com 

21. TCP server - write to connection

The request is just text...it needs to adhere to the HTTP protocol for our server to process the text.
Go doc has a 'net' package or 'net/http'
Telnet needs to be installed...or you should be able to enable it through control panel.

To run this, go run main.go into the code, and open telnet. Type the following:
telnet localhost 8080

22. TCP Server read from connection using bufio.Scanner 

23. I learned that this stuff works a little different on Mac...

24. TBH, according to Todd, we really won't use TCP too much

25. This is a dumb Rot13 example along with and in-memory database, which just a database 
stored in memory through commands.
I think I'll need the Telnet client open to run these examples. 

26. When we run this in the terminal, we get the following: 
 go run main.go
GET // HTTP/1.1 (***** This is the Request line *****)
***METHOD GET  (**** This is the method we inserted *****)
Host: localhost:8080 (***** Everything below this is the 'header' section ****)
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0

We can add anything in the localhost url when we run this (Example: http://localhost:8080//bigfuckingtittie)
