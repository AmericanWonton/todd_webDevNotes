42. Serving a file with io.Copy
We can serve content and files, like a picture, and put it into a writer.
The one that DOSEN'T  suck is http.FileServer
The files that actually work are under 02_serving

43. Serve file 
Etag is a way cahce is handled, (it's introductory). We don't really use ServeContent 

44. File FileServer
So now we are going to handle entire file folders in our directory. 

45. Serving a file with http.FileServer and & http.StripPrefix
Now we will learn how to serve files down to a specific folder 

46. Static File Server 

47. Log.Fatal and http.Error 
http.Error takes a response writer, some string phrase and status code, like 404. Sometimes you'll see constants 
used in place of 404. Example
http.Error(w, "file not found", 404(http.RequestNotFound))
Look at serve content in the 02_asset folder for an example. 

We really should do a review of all this stuff...just build a parsed file with all of the stuff learned from this lesson. 


50. The http.NotFoundHandler/ Favicon request.
