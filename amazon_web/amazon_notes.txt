75. Overview
We are in cloud computing...so we hire someone else to run our servers. 
EC2 Elastic cloud compute. It means 'elastic'. As traffic increase, you can scale up, or vice versa.
You can scan horizontally,(more machines) or vertically (more powerful machines).
We can create an Amazon Machine Image,(AMI) that is a program that runs on it's own and can be scaled.
You can have a load balancer which balances traffic to specific servers 
S3 storage,(where you store non-code important stuff like vids and pics)

76. Create a virtual server instance on AWS EC2 
There's instructions on how to do this in the README of 01_hello...lets see if they need updating... 
How do we keep a shell window open? (Using a damon script or whatever in 'User data' section of server)
We added HTTP under Security so anyone on the web can see it.
a PEM key is for security...you can see it in 01_hello...DON'T LOSE IT! It's asymetric encryption

77.On one of those steps, I had to change it to this:
scp -i D:/Go_Workspace/src/golang_webdev_tutorial/my_stuff/amazon_web/01_virtualServer/01_hello/my_key_pair.pem mybinary ubuntu@ec2-18-223-136-31.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:

78. Persisting an Application 
We want our application to continue running! 
There's a couple way to do it...we're gunna do Todd's way.
I also deleted the big ubunto file because I couldn't git add it: 
ubuntu@ec2-18-223-136-31.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws

to ssh in to the new Amazon maachine: 
ssh -i D:/Go_Workspace/src/golang_webdev_tutorial/my_stuff/amazon_web/01_virtualServer/01_hello/my_key_pair.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-223-136-31.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
my service file is called ourservice.service 

79/80 Hands on Exercise 
second key pair is in that folder 
Important copy stuff for second server: 
to SHH into the server:
ssh -i D:/Go_Workspace/src/golang_webdev_tutorial/my_stuff/amazon_web/02_hands-on/02_solution/second-keypair.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-14-9-153.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
to Add template files: 
scp -i D:/Go_Workspace/src/golang_webdev_tutorial/my_stuff/amazon_web/02_hands-on/02_solution/second-keypair.pem cowboyBuild ubuntu@ec2-52-14-9-153.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:the_server_directory_example

Where I put all this crap on the server: the_server_directory_example

81. Go to billing dashboard our watch the video to learn how to turn off those servers! You created a reminder too!
