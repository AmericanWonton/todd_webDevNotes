113. Organizing Code Into Packages
We have a 'models' folder for modeling stuff into the database
on user.go User needs to be capitalized to be exported! 

114. Create and Delete a User 
We can post User data with curl...kinda like Postman

115. MVC Design Pattern- Model View Controller
model = data 
controller = connects the view with the data 
So basically he moved all the functions from the main.go file to the controllers file  
Not gunna lie, I may just start on the Docker session and go look back at an older 
go project to do mongo....

I think I might come back to this later
