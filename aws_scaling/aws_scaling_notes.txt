88. Overview of Load Balancers
Load Balancers just round robins the request to servers, based on availability

89. Create EC2 Security Groups
So we can create a security group for web access, (port 80)
And one accessed by our PEM
We will also allow communication between machines with similar security rules
My Load Balancer ID: sg-0c48cbf09ab575833

90. Create an ELB Load Balancer 
Click on EC2 and Load Balancer 
Make sure you put the pem key in the 02 load balancer folder
myLBKey = mylbkeyvalue
build the code in 02_loadbalancer with the following: 
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o cowboy

secure copy that to here:
scp -i  D:/Go_Workspace/src/golang_webdev_tutorial/my_stuff/aws_scaling/02_load-balancer/second-keypair.pem cowboy ubuntu@ec2-52-14-9-153.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:

Then log into the web instance: 
ssh -i D:/Go_Workspace/src/golang_webdev_tutorial/my_stuff/aws_scaling/02_load-balancer/second-keypair.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-14-9-153.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

See cowboy binary file with this: 
ls -la 
It needs it's permissions changed: sudo chmod 777 cowboy

Pretty sure this is fucking up because we built the project at the root AND persisted it on this machine under the-example_directory
Might need to create a new instance to test this...
